# CIP_finalproject
Final project from Code in Place 2024

The goal is to make a little gadget that will showcase the Pomodoro Technique for productivity. The user should enter their daily tasks and divide them into pieces that last 25 minutes (or less, it is important that the pieces are the same length). After each task, there must be a short break, and after every third break, there is a longer break. The user sets the timer and does the task at the allotted time. When it's time to take a break (the gadget warns him) he can't do anything, ensuring that breaks are taken properly and productivity is maintained.
